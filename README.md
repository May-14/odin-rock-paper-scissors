This project is a demonstration of my current skills of javascript and problem solving. Although rock, paper, scissors, is a simple game in nature, this is my first real world problem solved using js. It allowed me to practice the correct way to solve problems: dividing it into small sub problems, using pseudo code, the duck technique and more. It showed me how to use the sort() method to sort an array of numbers, and more.

In the future I intend to add a ui interface to practice my html and css skills.
